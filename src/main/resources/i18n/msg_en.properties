I18N_1648167967145=A simple service for the practice of developing API tests.\n\n\n\
  The following types of errors are embedded in the service:\n\n\
  - functional errors\n\n\
  - contract errors\n\n\
  - specification errors\n\n\
  - system errors\n\n\
  \n\
  If API call contains a registered defect, then in the response from the server you will certainly receive a header \
  with the defect identifier (for example `bug-id: 1`) and in some cases several. For self-checking, you can call the `/api/bug?id={id}` method \
  and get the full description of the bug by its ID. But do not rush to use the hint, first make sure your conclusions \
  are reliable by reading the service logs (this is a very useful skill.).\n\n\

  <summary>You can also check the data in the DB (H2) or experiment.</summary>\n\n\
  \n\
  The DB web console is available along the path [current_host_port/h2](current_host_port/h2).\n\n\
  \n\
  Login `admin`, no password required.\n\n\
  \n\
  If you want to connect to the DB via tcp, then here is the URI:\n\n\
  \n\
   - `jdbc:h2:tcp://localhost:9092/./h2/automatron;USER=admin;PASSWORD=;`\n\n\
