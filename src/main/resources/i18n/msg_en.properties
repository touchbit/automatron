  The service has the following types of bugs:\n\n\
  - specification bugs (bug_type_specification_count) - insufficiency of ambiguity of requirements (swagger);\n\n\
  - implementation bugs (bug_type_implementation_count) - the implementation does not meet the requirements;\n\n\
  - architecture bugs (bug_type_architecture_count) - synthetic architectural errors (due to the specifics of the project, not all are documented);\n\n\
  - security bugs (bug_type_security_count) - related to access/passwords/personal data, etc.;\n\n\
  \n\
  Default Users (role - credentials):\n\n\
  - OWNER - login: `automatron`, password: `IDDQD`\n\n\
  - ADMIN - login: `admin`, password: `admin`\n\n\
  \n\
  If API call contains a registered defect, then in the response from the server you will certainly receive a header \
  with the defect identifier (for example `bug-id: 1`) and in some cases several. For self-checking, you can call the `/api/bug?id={id}` method \
  and get the full description of the bug by its ID. But do not rush to use the hint, first make sure your conclusions \
  are reliable by reading the service logs (this is a very useful skill.). \
  You can also check the data in the DB (H2) or experiment.\n\n\
