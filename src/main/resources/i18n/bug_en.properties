0001_info=Logging sensitive data
0001_description=When an authentication request is made, the service writes the user's password to the log.\n\
  CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n\
  Information written to log files can be of a sensitive nature \
  and give valuable guidance to an attacker or expose sensitive user information.\n\
  While logging all information may be helpful during development stages, \
  it is important that logging levels be set appropriately before a product \
  ships so that sensitive user data and system information are not accidentally exposed to potential attackers.
0002_info=No default value
0002_description=The specification does not specify a default value for the 'Locale' header. \n\
  If there is no header, it is assumed that the default values will be used. \n\
  In case the header value is not included in the list of valid values, then the default value should be used \
  or the server should return a 400 error (depending on the server implementation).
