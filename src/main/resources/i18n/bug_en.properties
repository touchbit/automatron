I18N_1648168652178=Logging sensitive data
I18N_1648168660813=When an authentication request is made, the service writes the user's password to the log.\n\
  CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File\n\
  Information written to log files can be of a sensitive nature \
  and give valuable guidance to an attacker or expose sensitive user information.\n\
  While logging all information may be helpful during development stages, \
  it is important that logging levels be set appropriately before a product \
  ships so that sensitive user data and system information are not accidentally exposed to potential attackers.
I18N_1648168667369=No default value
I18N_1648168674474=The specification does not specify a default value for the 'Locale' header. \n\
  If there is no header, it is assumed that the default values will be used. \n\
  In case the header value is not included in the list of valid values, then the default value should be used \
  or the server should return a 400 error (depending on the server implementation).
I18N_1648169003925=Incorrect HTTP status
I18N_1648169012151=The user is in the 'BLOCKED' status and does not have access to the service.\n\
  \ Expected HTTP status 403 'Access denied'.
I18N_1648401705690=Default value usage
I18N_1648401737946=If a value is passed that is not included in the list of possible \
  (permissible) values, then the default value should be used.\n\
  In the case of a logout request, if the 'mode' field is sent with a value of 'foobar', \
  then the server will use the value 'ALL' when the default value 'CURRENT' is expected.
